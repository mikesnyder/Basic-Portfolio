        <p>A long time ago, at a camp that took place after May-my interest in web design began. That was in middle school, and since then-every few years some form of coding would enter my life. In college, I studied marketing in college and took a job in supply chain once I graduated. As things slowed down at my job, I would dabble around on various sites learning about different programming languages. The reduced amount of work ended up leading to the company laying off 70 employees. I was one of them, and saw it as a blessing in disguise. I now have the time and funds to pursue down this road.
